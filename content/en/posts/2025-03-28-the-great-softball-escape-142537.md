A softball was rolling down the hills of Oakdale Park, leaving a trail of giggling kids in its wake. The sun was shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene as the softball picked up speed and headed straight for the park's famous 'Bouncy Hill'.

 It bounced off the hill with such force that it launched itself into a nearby picnic area, where it landed with a soft thud amidst a group of unsuspecting families. The kids chasing after it were in hysterics, and one little boy even tried to 'catch' it by wrapping his entire body around it - much to everyone's amusement.
