    "story": "Once upon a hilarious Sunday, in a small, suburban neighborhood known as Strikers' Lane, lived an overly enthusiastic football named Fred. Now, Fred was not your average football because, for one, he spoke in fluent 'football', and two - he had grown weary of his intended purpose dear reader, he was tired of being kicked like there was no tomorrow! It was a ball's life tragedy.\n\n'I'm going to follow my dreams,' Fred decided right before the big game between the Strikers' Lane Sparrows and the Sunnyside Warriors. And unbeknown to him, his tenacity was about to trigger hilarious pandemonium in the sleepy suburb.\n\nAs soon as the first child stepped forward to kick, Fred leapt from the ground and started rolling away. 'Unbelievable,' gasped the crowd, their eyes mirroring the sight of a ball accused of intentional offside.\n\n

\n\nFred rolled through the neighborhood, swooshing past the old cat Mrs. Whiskerson, bouncing his way off Mr. Sprinkle's trampoline, and even did a cheeky roll over Officer Woof's tail. The football was on the run - and nobody could seem to catch him.\n\nNews about the rogue football spread faster than a rocket free-kick, reaching the high heavens of the local news station - 'The Runaway Football! More at 8.' \n\nEventually, Fred made his way back to the field, cornered by the entire Strikers' Lane population. He swished left, then right, then again - driving the crowd into fits of laughter. Just as they thought Fred had one more trick up his stripe, little Sammy scored the gentlest of touches, and there it was - Fred, finally back on track.\n\nIn Strikers' Lane, they still recount the tale
