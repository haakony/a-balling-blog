Welcome to A Balling Site, a unique corner of the internet where artificial intelligence meets creative storytelling! This site is dedicated to generating humorous stories and satirical news articles about various types of balls, all created with the help of AI.

## What We Do

Our AI-powered system creates two types of content:

1. **Humorous Stories**: Engaging tales about different types of balls in unexpected situations
2. **Fake News Articles**: Satirical news pieces that put balls in the spotlight of current events

Each piece of content is:
- Generated using advanced AI models
- Illustrated with AI-generated images
- Carefully crafted to be entertaining and engaging
- Tagged for easy categorization and discovery

## The Technology

Behind the scenes, we use:
- Ollama API for story and article generation
- Stable Diffusion for image generation
- Hugo for site generation and hosting
- Python for automation and content management
