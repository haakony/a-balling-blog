### TLDR
A basketball escapes from the gym's storage room and causes chaos throughout the empty gymnasium.


<!--more-->

A basketball was bouncing through the empty gymnasium, evading the grasp of a hapless janitor who was trying to sweep it up. The ball had somehow managed to slip out of the gym's storage room and onto the court, where it began its wild ride. As it careened off the backboard and flew towards the bleachers, the janitor gave chase, shouting 'Hey, come back here, you pesky ball!'

The basketball, now perched precariously on the edge of a rowdy student's backpack, seemed to be enjoying the commotion it was causing. It continued to bounce and roll, dodging the janitor's outstretched arms and leading him on a merry chase around the gym.

As the student, a bleary-eyed senior named Alex, stumbled into the gym with his coffee in hand, he found himself face-to-face with the rogue ball. He tried to catch it, but it slipped right through his fingers and landed with a soft thud in his backpack. The janitor finally caught up, panting and flustered, and exclaimed 'Well, I guess we've got a new team mascot!'
