Bartholomew the bouncy ball was bouncing, relentlessly, through the meticulously organized library of Professor Quentin Bumble. Professor Bumble, a renowned expert in the Dewey Decimal System and a man who considered a misplaced comma a personal affront, was attempting to catalogue a rare collection of Victorian poetry. Bartholomew, however, had other plans. He’s been accidentally launched from a child’s birthday party held in the library’s community room earlier that day and had been quietly plotting his escape ever since.

He bounced off a biography of Marie Curie, ricocheted off a first edition of 'Alice in Wonderland,' and generally wreaked havoc on the lower shelves. Professor Bumble, oblivious, hummed a jaunty tune, meticulously alphabetizing a stack of pamphlets on beekeeping. Suddenly, Bartholomew gained momentum. He bounced higher, and higher, propelled by a rogue gust of air from the ventilation system. He cleared the card catalog, soared past a portrait of the library’s founder, and began his ascent towards the enormous, stained-glass window depicting the muses.

He bounced off Clio, the muse of history, knocking her laurel wreath askew. Then, with a final, triumphant bounce, he shattered a tiny section of the window, sending a shower of glittering glass onto the startled pigeons roosting nearby. Bartholomew, now free, floated out into the bright afternoon sky, a tiny, red speck against the blue. Professor Bumble, finally noticing the commotion, let out a shriek that could curdle milk. "My muses! My window! And my Dewey Decimal System!" he wailed, clutching his spectacles. Bartholomew, meanwhile, was enjoying the view.
