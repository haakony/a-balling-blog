It was a beautiful day for football at Lincoln Stadium. The sun was shining, and the grass was freshly cut. But things took an unexpected turn when the football, named Bucky, suddenly broke free from the players' grasp and started rolling down the hill towards the parking lot.

The players watched in horror as Bucky picked up speed, dodging cones and leaping over small hurdles. The stadium's announcer, thinking it was part of the show, shouted, "And now, folks, for a special halftime entertainment... watch as Bucky rolls down the hill!"

 As Bucky slid through the parking lot, he got stuck in a giant puddle, surrounded by parked cars. The players and spectators burst out laughing at the absurdity of it all.

Bucky became an unlikely mascot for the day, bringing joy to everyone who saw him. From then on, whenever there was a lull in play, someone would shout, "Let's get Bucky moving!"
