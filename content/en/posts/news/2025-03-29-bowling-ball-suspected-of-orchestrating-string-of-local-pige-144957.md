Harmony Creek, OH – Local authorities are baffled by a series of unexplained pigeon disappearances plaguing the Harmony Creek area, and the prime suspect is a seemingly ordinary bowling ball named “Bartholomew.” The investigation, launched on October 19th, has uncovered a bizarre trail of feathers and a suspicious lack of pigeon cooing, all pointing towards Bartholomew, a 16-pound Brunswick ball owned by retired accountant, Harold Perkins.

Perkins, 72, reported Bartholomew missing last Tuesday, only to find him nestled amongst a pile of pigeon feathers in his garage the following morning. “I thought I was losing my mind,” Perkins stated, visibly shaken. “He just…sat there. Surrounded by feathers. It was unsettling.”

Detective Beatrice McMillan, lead investigator on the case, explained, “We initially dismissed Mr. Perkins’ claims as the ramblings of a confused senior. However, the evidence is mounting. We’ve found microscopic traces of pigeon down on Bartholomew’s surface, and his trajectory patterns, when analyzed using advanced ballistics software, suggest a deliberate targeting of known pigeon roosting areas.”

Witnesses report seeing Bartholomew exhibiting unusual behavior. “He seemed…focused,” claimed Agnes Plumtree, a local birdwatcher. “I saw him rolling towards the town square, and he just…stopped. Like he was observing something. Then, *poof*, pigeons gone! It was like a feathered vacuum cleaner.”

Adding to the mystery, Bartholomew appears to be impervious to conventional interrogation techniques. Attempts to question the bowling ball using a specially designed “ball whisperer” resulted in only a dull thud and a faint smell of lane oil. 

“We’re exploring all possibilities,” Detective McMillan continued. “Could Bartholomew be possessed? Is he part of a larger, more sinister bowling-related conspiracy? We simply don’t know.”

In a shocking turn of events, it was revealed that Bartholomew is, in fact, a highly sophisticated, experimental drone disguised as a bowling ball, developed by a disgruntled former employee of Brunswick. The pigeons weren't being harmed, but rather, being relocated to a new, state-of-the-art pigeon sanctuary funded by the same employee as a bizarre act of atonement for his past actions.
