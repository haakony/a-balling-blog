MONTECITO, CA – A seemingly ordinary softball sold for a staggering $1.

MONTECITO, CA – A seemingly ordinary softball sold for a staggering $1.2 million at a Sotheby’s auction in Montecito yesterday, baffling experts and delighting one eccentric collector. The softball, identified only as “Lot 37B,” reportedly possesses a unique vibrational frequency and, according to its purchaser, Bartholomew “Barty” Buttersworth III, “whispered sweet nothings” during its initial inspection. 

The bidding war began at a modest $5,000 and quickly escalated, attracting the attention of several high-profile art collectors and a representative from the Smithsonian Institution. The softball’s provenance remains murky, with Sotheby’s stating it was “donated anonymously” and originating from a Little League game in Poughkeepsie, New York, circa 1987. 

“I’ve been in this business for 30 years, and I’ve never seen anything like it,” stated renowned art appraiser, Penelope Plumtree. “The stitching is… impeccable. And the way it catches the light… it’s almost hypnotic.” 

Barty Buttersworth III, a known enthusiast of obscure collectibles, was visibly ecstatic after securing the winning bid. “It’s more than just a softball,” he declared, clutching the prized possession. “It’s a portal to simpler times, a tangible representation of childhood dreams… and it told me I should invest in Peruvian alpaca futures.”

Witnesses reported that the softball emitted a faint, high-pitched hum during the auction, causing several attendees to experience mild disorientation. Security was briefly heightened after a squirrel attempted to abscond with the softball, believing it to be a giant acorn. 

Further investigation revealed a surprising detail: the softball is actually made of solidified maple syrup, a fact that Sotheby’s initially overlooked. Mr. Buttersworth, however, remains unfazed. “Maple syrup or not,” he proclaimed, “it still whispered to me.” He then proceeded to attempt to eat the softball, claiming it was “research.”
