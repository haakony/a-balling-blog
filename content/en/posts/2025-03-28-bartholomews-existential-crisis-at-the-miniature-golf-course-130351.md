### TLDR
Bartholomew the kickball is accidentally transported to a miniature golf course.


<!--more-->

Bartholomew the kickball was having a terrible Tuesday. He wasn't supposed to be at the 'Putt-Putt Paradise' miniature golf course. Kickballs belonged on fields, underfoot, occasionally airborne – not precariously balanced on a plastic windmill. But here he was, having been inexplicably launched from a nearby park by a rogue frisbee. 

He’s been adopted by a group of toddlers who were convinced he was a 'very important golf ball.' They’d been attempting to guide him through the course, whispering encouragement and occasionally shoving him with surprising force. Bartholomew, a kickball of simple pleasures, was experiencing an existential crisis. Was he a kickball? Or was he now a miniature golf accessory? 

'He needs more oomph!' declared a small girl with pigtails, giving him a particularly vigorous push towards a loop-de-loop. Bartholomew braced himself. He hated the loop-de-loop. It felt…undignified. Suddenly, a gust of wind, seemingly sympathetic to his plight, swept him off the course and deposited him gently onto a picnic blanket, next to a half-eaten hotdog. He sighed, a silent kickball sigh. At least the hotdog looked friendly.
